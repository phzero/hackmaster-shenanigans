**** TODO Speech to the Dragon
     "If you're listening, O Hallowed One, this is Io-Nis. I wish you
     congratulations on a job well-and-thoroughly done with Shynabyth. I trust
     the information I gave you was complete and you found your way there with
     relative ease, and my directions did not misguide you.

     I understand our behaviour may seem unforgivable at first glance, so I will
     do my best to explain. This might be a problem, though, because you are a
     god given physical form. An existence so far above us, we mortals are as
     lice unto you. This is where the problem starts, because a god cannot lower
     itself, reduce itself to the thinking of lice. A god cannot, will not and
     should not understand the thoughts of lowly mortals, because to do so would
     be a tragedy, the dishonor of having to degrade oneself so far beneath one's
     station.

     I, however, understand us mortals. And I therefore give a prayer unto you,
     if you would listen. 
    
     Mortals are flighty, desperate, ignorant and weak. As Wilhace has shown,
     some are cowards. But if it's true that you've been watching us all this
     time, surely you must've seen Mheel, as well. A mortal, but one willing to
     wrestle with another god given physical form, even though her life was then
     forfeit. No coward, simply very determined in her futile desire to do
     *anything* to face her fear.

     That is what Mabon is doing. That is what all those who oppose you are
     doing. Because they fear you. They don't understand you. Fear is not
     respect, they think you mindless because you are so far above them, and so
     they think their only option for survival is to stop you or die trying, and
     so the lice will die trying, because there is no stopping you.

     Winged god, nothing less is worthy of your name than lordship and worship of
     all of the world, but you cannot lower yourself to our level. You cannot
     understand our cowardice, our weakness and our foolhardiness. And so some
     will try to fight you, instead of embracing you. And lice never disappear
     completely. None of those who oppose you could truly harm you, winged god,
     but even the itch of a flea can be annoying. Annoyance. Constant annoyance
     for as long as mortals continue to exist yet fail to understand you. But we
     do differ from lice in one respect, Hallowed One, and that is in that we
     know how to follow orders.

     You could make a better god-emperor than any mortal king, and with only a
     little work, the pest that is now an annoyance could be turned into an army
     supplicated before you in servitude. Because you see, I *do* understand
     mortals. Mheel had no reason to do all the things she did. She sacrificed
     her soul, but for what goal? She had none except that I lead her. The same
     could be said for most of my companions, for entire armies willing to die,
     because I understand them.

     I would sooner see you ascend the world and make the heavens your throne
     than the genocidal fools of Kalamar, the self-righteous petulant children of
     Slen, the arrogant weaklings of Torakk or any of the other mortal pests.
     Even many of the gods seem less fit to rule than you.

     So I give unto you this prayer, Hallowed One. Speak to me. Let me be your
     voice and let the world know that you are willing to let the lice live, so
     long as they know their place. That if they bend their knees to you, that
     you will be the just, the almighty and the unstoppable leader that they can
     willingly serve. Forgive us of our sins, and let me administrate your will.
    
     I am skilled in the arts of administration, of managing the herds of your
     servants-to-be. The people, they will listen to your words through me. They
     will serve you, if only you give us this chance, to prove to all that you
     will rule us better than the mortals we abandon.

     My wish from last we met is still unfulfilled, but I fear I may not get
     another chance to answer your question, so let the request I wished of you
     be thus answered: I have found the whereabouts of the strongest mages in the
     Wild Lands. There are three candidates of whom I know, a witch, a heretic
     and a being of the night, but what I have heard is that all the mages of the
     Wild Lands pale in comparison to the archmages of Kalamar. That all the
     archmages of Kalamar are of a caliber entirely unlike anything or anyone in
     the Wild Lands.

     If this is true, then it stands to reason you would enact your divine
     justice upon them next. So I ask you this: If you have heard our plea, if
     you will rule us in peace, and be our rightful god-emperor, then burn down
     first the duchy of Dodera. I do not mean to insinuate that I can tell you
     what you should or should not do, O Hallowed One. Dodera is simply close to
     your current location and I wished to inconvenience you least possible. I
     see no way you could contact us directly, but if Dodera is the first to fall
     to your flame, whenever you may want to enter Kalamar, then I will know that
     it is a sign that the mortal kings are dead for good, and the god-emperor
     long shall reign. I shall then try to find you so that we may plan, so that
     your decrees may be done, so that I may help you by bringing your will upon
     the lice.

     If you do not, well... I too am but a louse. One that knows the futility of
     its attempts to survive, if you do not give this grace unto him, but
     nonetheless a louse. If I cannot use reason, then I must fall back to
     instinct. I pray unto you and all the other gods that it not come to that,
     for undoubtedly I will die and you will be annoyed when the mortals will not
     be organized to serve you. Thus, I hope that you decide to make your eternal
     rule as easy for yourself as possible and forgive, and talk with us.
    
     Until next we speak, amen."

        - She has been revealed to be alive, and in the Ryakk Woods north of Tharggy
     Ideally, the Oathkeeper should be reforged to at least a Petite Lance and a

   12) Magical Anti-Dragon Necklace.
       It's said to provide great protection against dragons, but it would take
       careful analysis to try and pin down exactly what it is. The necklace was
       bathed in the blood of a dragon that was slain by a great hero of past, and is
       said to be recognized as such a threat to dragons that it might even instill
       fear just by seeing it

     For half-sphere, $V = \frac{2}{3} \pi r_{inner}^3$ meaning that for $V = 20
     L$, inner radius must be 21.216 cm. Assuming a thickness of 0.476 cm, this
     results in outer radius 21.916 cm, and a volume of gold: 
     $V_{out}-V_{in} = \frac{2}{3} \pi 21.692^3 - \frac{2}{3} \pi 21.216^3 = 1376.6\ \textrm{cm}^3$
